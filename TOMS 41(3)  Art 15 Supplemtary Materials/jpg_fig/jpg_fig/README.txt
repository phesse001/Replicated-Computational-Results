The supplementary material for the article 'Replicated Computational Results
(RCR) Report for "BLIS: A Framework for Rapidly Instantiating BLAS
Functionality"' is organized into three directories:

1. scripts - these scripts were used to create the performance graphs in
   Figures 13-15 in the BLIS article, as well as the graphs for the replicated
   results for the BLIS RCR report.

2. output - these performance output files were created for the BLIS RCR
   report.

3. jpg_fig - these performance graphs were generated for the BLIS RCR report.

 The scripts in 1 require the output files in 2 to generate the graphs in
 3. When running one of the scripts in Matlab, the associated output files
 should be in the same directory as the script.
